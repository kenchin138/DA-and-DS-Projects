# **Data Analysis and Data Science Portfolio**

Welcome! This GitHub repository serves as a place to store and document a few of the data analysis and data science projects I have undertaken, either for clients or my own personal use. 

My goal is to upload more projects as I learn new techniques, methods, and best practices during my data analytics journey. 

Some of my dashboards can be found on my [Tableau Public profile](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ken.chin)
